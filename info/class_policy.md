## Grading, lateness, and extensions 

The grade break-down will be as follows:
- Homework: 40%
- Final project: 30%
- Midterm exam: 20%
- Class Participation: 10%

The grade-assignment cutoffs will be *no higher than*: A - 90%, B - 80%, C - 70%.

Late homework:
- Homework turned in late will be subject to the following penalties: 1 day = 5%, 2 days = 10%, 3 days = 20%, 4 or more days = not accepted.
- The lowest two homework grades will be dropped from the calculations.

Late projects:
- Projects turned in late will be subject to the following penalties: 1 day = 5%, 2 days = 10%, 3 days = 20%, 4 days = 40%, more than 4 days = not accepted. 

Extensions:
- If you are having health or personal problems, definitely take it easy. Email us and we will make arrangements for extensions. 
- *There will be no further extensions given for other reasons*

## Collaboration with humans and computers

We view the homework and projects as teaching tools and the exams as
evaluation tools. As part of the teaching process we will provide some
feedback on your homework and projects.  We encourage you to discuss
assignments with other students and with the teaching staff to better
understand the concepts.

Ultimately, it is your responsibility to ensure that you personally understand the course material, so be sure you devote concentrated independent effort to solving all the problems.

- You should **NOT** use AI-assistants, such as co-pilot, for help with any coding assignments.  
- You may use large language models to assist with superficial grammatical corrections of your writing, but not to provide or suggest content.

In all cases, you remain personally responsible for the originality, correctness and quality of your submissions. 

## Support

### GradSupport

For graduate students, a variety of issues may impact your academic career including faculty/student relationships, funding, and interpersonal concerns. In the Office of Graduate Education (OGE), GradSupport provides consultation, coaching, and advocacy to graduate students on matters related to academic and life challenges. If you are dealing with an issue that is impacting your ability to attend class, complete work, or take an exam, you may contact GradSupport by email at <a href="mailto:gradsupport@mit.edu">gradsupport@mit.edu</a>
or via phone at (617) 253-4860. More info can be found at [GradSupport](https://oge.mit.edu/development/gradsupport/).

### Student Support Services
For undergrad students, if you are dealing with a personal or medical issue that is impacting your ability to attend class, complete work, or take an exam, you should contact a dean in Student Support Services (S3). S3 is here to help you. The deans will verify your situation, provide you with support, and help you work with your professor or instructor to determine next steps. In most circumstances, you will not be excused from coursework without verification from a dean. Please visit the [S3 website](https://studentlife.mit.edu/s3) for contact information and more ways that they can provide support.


### Disability and Access Services
We are committed to the principle of equal access, and we are more
than willing to make arrangements to help accommodate students with
disabilities or related challenges. In general, knowing about the kind
of help you need earlier in the semester means that we'll be better
prepared to provide that help effectively, in coordination
with Disability and Access Services.
If you have a disability and are not planning to use accommodations,
it is still recommended that you meet with DAS staff to familiarize
yourself with their services and resources. If you have been approved
for accommodations by DAS, 6.790 staff are ready to assist with
implementation. 

Please send these approved requests
to inform us, and we will work to implement these accommodations.

### Mental Health
MIT is a challenging environment, and 6.790 is a challenging course.  As such,
it is normal to expect some level of stress (and a lot of hard work) during
6.790.  A certain level of stress is healthy and is part of the learning
process (if it were easy, you probably wouldn't be learning much!).  However,
too much stress can be a bad thing, and if you are feeling overwhelmed, we want
to help, so please don't hesitate to reach out.

Additionally, if you or someone you know is struggling with mental health
issues (including significant stress, mood changes, excessive worry,
substance/alcohol abuse, or problems with eating or sleeping), we strongly
encourage you to contact or visit one or more of the following resources, who
may be able to provide additional guidance and support:

* [GradSupport](https://oge.mit.edu/development/gradsupport/)
* [Student Support Services](https://studentlife.mit.edu/s3)
* [MIT Medical: Student Mental Health and Counseling](https://medical.mit.edu/services/mental-health-counseling)
* [MIT Peer Ears](https://peerears.mit.edu/)
