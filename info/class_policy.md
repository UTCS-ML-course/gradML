## Collaboration with humans and computers

We view the homework and projects as teaching tools and the exams as
evaluation tools. As part of the teaching process we will provide some
feedback on your homework and projects.  We encourage you to discuss
assignments with other students and with the teaching staff to better
understand the concepts.

Ultimately, it is your responsibility to ensure that you personally understand the course material, so be sure you devote concentrated independent effort to solving all the problems.

- You should **NOT** use AI-assistants, such as co-pilot, for help with any coding assignments.  
- You may use large language models to assist with superficial grammatical corrections of your writing, but not to provide or suggest content.

In all cases, you remain personally responsible for the originality, correctness and quality of your submissions.
